# MinecraftClone
This project is my attempt to create a somewhat convincing clone of the popular game Minecraft from scratch in Unity. This is by no means a complete recreation of Minecraft, though it does include a few core features.

I created this project for fun in my free time with no plan for how I wanted it to turn out. Because of this, the code is not optimal and could certainly be improved.

## Features
- Infinite world generation
- Fully modifiable terrain
- Block updates
  - Block gravity
  - Basic water flow
- Simple user interface
  - Hotbar
  - Start menu
  - Pause menu
- Usable items
  - Ender pearls
  - TNT (throwable)
  - Bone meal
